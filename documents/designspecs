Software Design Plan
====================

***User GUI Perspective
-First launch
	-User sees menubar at top
		-Manage Minecraft versions
			-Custom and vanilla ones
			-Download vanilla minecrafts
			-Manage custom libraries
		-Help menu
			-License!
            -Github link
            -Email?
	-User sees welcome tab
        -Welcome tab never closes
        -Boxed area for logging in or offline mode
            -Username, password, and login button
                -Once logged in, have an option for log out
		-Another boxed area with a list of minecraft profiles.
            -User double-clicks a profile from the list
			    -Select a Minecraft to launch (custom or vanilla)
			    -Optionally log-in below the list of Minecrafts
			    -Launch button!
			    -Do not allow multiple Minecrafts to launch in any one profile
			    -Show standard output?
			    -After closing
				    -Let players select a different Minecraft to launch
            -User selects a profile and...
                -Specifies delete. The user will confirm deletion.
                -Specifies rename. The user will see a new dialog box with a textbox with the current profile name
                -Speicifes "View Profile Data". The user will see their default or configured file manager open to the "data" directory.

***Somewhat Technical Details
-Downloading a vanilla version of Minecraft:
    -Create new vanilla directory with files:
        -Download the version's .json file
        -Download the version's .jar file
    -Create new entry in bin/index.json
    -Download libraries for all platforms as defined by the version's .json
        -Add entries in lib/index.json
    -Download resources? (or does that happen when Minecraft opens...)

-Logging in
    -Magic happens
        -See MinecraftCoalition
